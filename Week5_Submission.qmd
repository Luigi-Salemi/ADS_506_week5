# Part I: Shiny App Features

## App Links

**Deployed App URL**: [Your deployed app URL here]

**Code Repository**: [Your GitHub repository URL here]

## Feature List

My Australian Wine Sales Forecasting Shiny app includes the following features:

### Core Functionality
- **Interactive Varietal Selection**: Multi-select checkbox interface for choosing wine varietals
- **Flexible Date Range Controls**: User-defined training start and end dates with dropdown selectors
- **Multiple Forecasting Models**: TSLM, ETS, and ARIMA with toggle controls
- **User-Defined Forecast Horizon**: Adjustable forecast period (1-24 months)
- **Responsive UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with sensible defaults

### Tab 1: Visualization
- Faceted time series plots with free y-scales for accurate comparison across varietals
- Visual training/validation split indicator (red dashed line)
- Summary statistics table showing observations, mean, SD, min, and max by varietal
- Professional styling with clear labels and titles

### Tab 2: Model Building
- **Model Specifications Table**: Displays ETS component form (e.g., ETS(M,A,M)) and ARIMA orders (p,d,q)(P,D,Q)[m]
- **Training Accuracy Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, and MAPE for each model on training data
- **Validation Accuracy Metrics**: Same metrics calculated on holdout validation set
- **Combined Accuracy Comparison**: Side-by-side training vs validation metrics with spanners for easy comparison

### Tab 3: Forecast
- Comparative forecast visualization in faceted grid (Varietal × Model)
- 80% and 95% prediction intervals clearly displayed
- Training data shown alongside forecasts for context
- Clear legend distinguishing models and confidence levels
- Forecast details table showing point estimates

### Additional Features
- **About Tab**: Documentation of app features, dataset, and model descriptions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing validation data
- **Data Quality**: Automatic handling of non-numeric values and missing data
- **Performance**: Fast model fitting and responsive updates

### Technical Excellence
- No hard-coded file paths (project-relative paths only)
- Handles multiple varietals simultaneously without errors
- Clean separation of UI and server logic
- Proper reactive programming patterns
- Professional data visualization with ggplot2 and gt tables

# Part II: Data Story

## Story Focus

[Your compelling insight here - e.g., "Sparkling wine shows extreme seasonal volatility with December sales spiking 3x the annual average, and the ETS model with multiplicative seasonality captures this pattern far better than linear models."]
