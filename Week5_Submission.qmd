# Part II: Data Story

## Story Focus: Varietal-Specific Patterns Reveal Different Forecasting Challenges

The comparative forecast visualization reveals that Australian wine varietals exhibit dramatically different sales patterns, requiring different modeling approaches. This analysis examines how TSLM, ETS, and ARIMA models perform across six wine varietals with varying characteristics.

## Evidence and Analysis

**Reproduction Steps**:
- App URL: <https://connect.posit.cloud/luigi-salemi-usd/content/019ab93b-d522-6571-32d0-7cf8442ae99c>
- Settings:
  - Varietals: All six varietals selected (Dry white, Fortified, Red, Rose, sparkling, Sweet white)
  - Training Start: 1980 Jan
  - Training End: 1992 Dec
  - Forecast Horizon: 12 months
  - Models: ARIMA, ETS, TSLM (all enabled)
  - Tab: Forecast

**Sparkling Wine Shows Extreme Seasonal Volatility**

The bottom row shows sparkling wine with massive December spikes - sales jump from ~1,500 to over 5,000 thousand liters during holidays (3-4x increase). ETS produces the widest prediction intervals reflecting this volatility, while TSLM shows narrower, more confident intervals. This extreme seasonality requires distributors to plan for 3-4x inventory increases in November-December.

**Sweet White Wine Underwent Market Transformation**

Sweet White (second-to-bottom row) experienced explosive growth starting around 1985, growing from 100-150 to over 600 thousand liters by 1993 (600% growth). The three models respond differently: ARIMA flattens too quickly, ETS captures upward momentum with wider intervals, and TSLM projects confident linear continuation. This demonstrates the importance of regular model retraining for high-growth products.

**Red Wine Shows Steady, Predictable Growth**

Red wine (top row) displays consistent upward trend with minimal seasonality. All three models produce nearly identical forecasts with tight prediction intervals, showing that model choice matters less for stable markets.

**Fortified Wine Displays Declining Trend**

Fortified wine (second row) shows a slight downward trend, suggesting changing consumer preferences. All three models agree on the declining trajectory with moderate seasonal patterns.

**Dry White Dominates in Volume**

Dry white (third row) shows the highest sales volumes (4,000-5,000 thousand liters) with strong seasonal patterns, representing the largest market segment.

**Rose Shows Minimal Seasonal Variation**

Rose (fifth row) has low sales volumes (100-300 thousand liters) with minimal seasonal effects. All three models produce similar forecasts.

## Model Comparison

- **ARIMA** (left) produces narrower intervals, sometimes underestimates high-growth trends
- **ETS** (middle) produces wider intervals for volatile series, reflecting appropriate uncertainty
- **TSLM** (right) shows confident linear projections but may not adapt to regime changes

The red dashed line marks the training cutoff (December 1992). Shaded regions show 80% and 95% prediction intervals.

## Conclusion

Australian wine sales forecasting requires varietal-specific strategies. Sparkling wine needs models handling extreme seasonality, Sweet White needs approaches adapting to rapid growth, and Red wine can use simpler models. Inventory planning must be differentiated by varietal - a one-size-fits-all approach leads to overstocking stable products while understocking volatile ones.
